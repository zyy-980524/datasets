# datasets
    In this experiment, data acquisition sensors, i.e., inertial measurement unit (IMU) and CAN interface card are used to collect data on steering angle, speed, lateral acceleration and yaw rate.
* The datasets are sensor data collected by the unmanned vehicle in the five different maneuvers. 
* The five different maneuvers are random speed and constant speed (v = 0.6m/s, v = 0.8m/s, v = 1.0m/s, v = 1.2m/s), respectively.
* There are six txt documents, and the data under the randomized experiment are divided for training and testing.
    * Randomized_experiment_test.txt
    * Randomized_experiment_train.txt
    * Serpentine_experiment_v=0_6ms.txt
    * Serpentine_experiment_v=0_8ms.txt
    * Serpentine_experiment_v=1_0ms.txt
    * Serpentine_experiment_v=1_2ms.txt
* The first and second columns of each txt document are respectively the vehicle speed and the steering angle. The third and fourth columns of each txt document are respectively the lateral acceleration and the yaw rate.
